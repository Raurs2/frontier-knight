# Frontier Knight
My first Godot game was made almost entirely by myself. I followed the GDQuest tutorial for the base Vampire Survivors gameplay, but for the rest of the systems and the additions on the survivors like system, I tried my best to develop it on my own while searching and learning about the engine and its nodes. I would like to finish it one day, but for now, my priority is to use my free time to study Unreal Engine and 3D game development.
