messages = Array[String](["-PROLOGUE 2-", "For two thousand years, humans and monsters have been fighting.", "A bloody battle that, until now, has seen no end.", "You are a frontline guard whose task is to protect the northernmost route between human and monster territories.", "Arriving at your house, located between the human border and the forest leading to the monster realm, you sense something off. The door seems unlocked. You ready your sword and slowly but steadily approach the entrance. When you reach your door, you push it open fast, weapon raised, prepared for an ambush.", "But there is no soldier, no ambush, just a scared child eating your food. Seeing your bloodstained armor and the weapon pointed at her, she begins to cry and tremble in the corner of the kitchen.", "You stand there, perplexed, remaining in stance for a moment. After processing the situation, you sheath your sword and remove your helmet.", "Calm down, I’m not gonna hurt you, you say, raising your hands slowly in a reassuring gesture.", "Uwahhh! Wahhhh! The girl continues to cry, trembling, unable to move.", "As you step closer, you notice she isn’t just a human child. She has traces of monster features, she must be a half-blood. Judging by her ragged clothes, she is likely an orphan as well.", "You remain there, silently analyzing the girl as she sobs, her cries gradually subsiding.", "Mister, I… I’m sorry… Please don’t hurt me.", "Her eyes are filled with fear as she speaks. She must have had a tough upbringing—half-bloods are the most hated beings, despised by both monsters and humans alike. Most are abandoned and never live to adulthood.", "I won’t hurt you. You don’t need to be afraid.", "The girl, still clutching the bread she was eating, glares at you warily, distrustful. She must not be used to receiving reassuring words.", "The bread… You can eat it.", "She hesitates but, after a moment, hunger wins over fear, and she resumes eating. You watch as she devours the bread as if her life depends on it.", "After pondering for a while, you head to the magic ice storage. The girl flinches as you move but remains in place, focused on her meal. You retrieve some milk, pour it into a cup, and return to her.", "Here, I got some milk for you.", "Tha-thank you… she meekly accepts the cup and gulps it down. Her face brightens slightly—she must not have had milk in a long time.", "Watching this small, frail child stirs something within you, a feeling you thought you had lost after a lifetime as a soldier. Maybe it’s because you were once a war orphan too, abandoned and left to fend for yourself. ", "Maybe it’s because you’ve grown older and more sentimental. Or maybe… it’s because you’ve been lonely, guarding this frontier all alone.", "You’re not sure of the reason, but an idea begins to take root in your mind. And when you decide something, you see it through.", "Do you have a place to return to?", "The girl freezes, sadness washing over her face. She simply shakes her head.", "You can stay here if you want.", "As soon as you say it, you stand up, begin removing your armor, and start preparing dinner. The girl remains in the corner, puzzled by your sudden offer.", "She snaps back to her senses when she smells the food. Then, hesitantly, she approaches.", "C-can I help with anything?", "You gesture toward the cupboard and the table. She quickly understands and begins setting the table while you finish cooking.", "When the meal is ready, you place the food on the prepared table, where the girl has been patiently waiting. The two of you eat in silence. Confusion is still written on her face at the unexpected turn of events, while you simply focus on your food, expressionless.", "Once dinner is finished, you begin washing the dishes, but she offers to help. Leaving that task to her, you prepare a bed for her, take a bath, show her how to warm the water, and then head to sleep.", "As usual, or perhaps, not so usual, you go through your nightly routine.", "And when morning comes, you wake up and begin making breakfast, just as always.", "But this time, something unusual happens.", "You are greeted with a smile and a soft, Good morning."])
